# Title: Movie Royale

Movie Royale eliminates the constant squalling and headaches that come from a movie night. Rather than scrolling through Netflix or another stream service, get ahead of the game by using Movie royale to quickly and effectively recommend and vote on your favorite movie! After creating an account, simply send the room code to your friends. Once in the room, everyone will be able to persue, recommend, and vote on what to watch as a group. This app can be accessed by anyone with wifi and a computer or mobile device, so you can figure out your watch party plans before the pizza gets cold.

    2. As a user without an account, I want to be able to enter a room code from another user.
    3. As a user, I want to be able to share the room code with my friends (via a share button that sends texts/emails for me).
    4. As a user, I want to be able to post a trailer link when I suggest a movie.
    5. As a user, I want to be able to get the description/synopsis of a movie that has been recommended.
